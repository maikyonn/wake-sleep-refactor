# Staria: Hierarchical Music Generation via Wake-Sleep Learning
## Research Proposal and Development Roadmap

---

## Abstract

This project presents **Staria**, a novel approach to long-form music generation that combines hierarchical encoder-decoder architectures with wake-sleep inspired training. The system learns compressed musical representations through snippet-based encoding and generates coherent, structured music through conditioned decoding. This proposal outlines the current achievements, identifies key research contributions, and suggests improvements for advancing the state-of-the-art in AI music generation.

## 1. Research Motivation and Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Music Generation
- **Long-range dependency modeling**: Traditional autoregressive models struggle with coherent long-form composition
- **Computational efficiency**: Full-sequence attention is prohibitively expensive for long musical pieces
- **Structural understanding**: Most models lack explicit awareness of musical form and hierarchy
- **Style control**: Limited ability to generate music with specific stylistic characteristics

### Novel Approach: Wake-Sleep Music Learning
The project addresses these challenges through a hierarchical approach inspired by wake-sleep algorithms:
- **Wake phase**: Learn compressed representations of musical structure via snippet encoding
- **Sleep phase**: Generate full compositions conditioned on learned representations
- **Structural awareness**: Explicit modeling of musical sections (A, B, C, D forms)

---

## 2. Technical Architecture and Novel Contributions

### 2.1 Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Design
```
Snippet Input → Encoder (6L, 8H, 1536D) → Compressed Representation
                                              ↓
Decoder Prompt → Decoder (16L, 24H, 1536D) → Full Generation
```

**Key Innovation**: Unlike flat sequence-to-sequence models, Staria operates on two levels:
1. **Structural level**: Encoder processes 256-token musical snippets
2. **Compositional level**: Decoder generates full sequences (up to 4096 tokens)

### 2.2 Snippet-Based Learning
- **Musical snippet extraction**: Segments from different sections (A/B/C/D) with proper form labels
- **Contrastive pre-training**: NT-Xent loss on augmented snippet pairs
- **Hierarchical conditioning**: Decoder attends to snippet representations during generation

### 2.3 Staged Training Protocol
1. **Stage A**: Cross-attention and adapter training only
2. **Stage B**: Progressive decoder unfreezing with reduced learning rates
3. **Stage C**: Full system fine-tuning with encoder unfreezing

### 2.4 Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline
- **Form-aware synthesis**: Generates training data with balanced musical forms (AB, ABC, ABA, ABAB, etc.)
- **Timing normalization**: Proper MIDI timing coordination for multi-section pieces
- **Style preservation**: Maintains consistent style labels throughout synthetic compositions

## 4. Identified Bugs and Technical Issues
